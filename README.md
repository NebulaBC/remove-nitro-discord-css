# remove-nitro-discord-css
CSS theme for discord to remove nitro. Best paired with FakeNitro emoji replacement so you don't run into the nitro wall with emojis.

Have you ever wished that you could forget nitro exists? I strongly dislike Discord, and as features have released and new popups have been added, I've filtered them out with CSS.  
I decided to share this theme so others can ditch Discord's aggressive advertising.
